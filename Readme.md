There is one setting to do before starting with our project :

The most important is set the access to the database. 
To do it, you will to open the Class DataAccess located in the folder 
src/main/java/models/dao or the just in the package models.dao of the project.

1.  find the archive DataFiles.rar in the folder Database located at the root of the project
2.  uncompress anywhere on your drive
3.  go into DataAccess class, and change the variable "mainPath" by assigning it the location 
    of files that constitute the database 
    
    
    Example: mainPath = "c:\\DataFiles";  //DataFiles contains our files and is at the root of the drive

Find the detailed presentation of the project in a powerpoint file at the root of the project.
